# InstagramUnfollowers
### A script that finds all the bad people who don't follow you back

##
### How to use it?

Simply just run the script as it follows: `python3 instagramUnfollowers.py {username} {password}`

##
### Future plans:
- [ ] Storing all the *followers* in a Trie structure to speed up checking if a *following* is a *follower*
